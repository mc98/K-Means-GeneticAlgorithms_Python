# K-Means-GeneticAlgorithms_Python
This is a project in the course Algorithms for optimization and big data analysis

## Overview of the Project
Generate data to form n clusters
Write k-means algorithm from scratch and visualize the results on a graph
Solve the clustering problem using genetic algorithm
## Methodology
Rough outline of our proposed algorithm:

- Generate sample data
- Run the K-means algorithm
- Initialize a random population based on K-means output
- Compute the objective function on this population
- Perform selection
- Perform crossover
- Perform mutation
- Repeat from selection step for a fixed number of iterations
## To run this project

Clone this repo: https://github.com/gurpreetsingh14/kmeans-with-GA.git
Follow example.py file or if you use jupyter notebook, use demo_class.ipynb
